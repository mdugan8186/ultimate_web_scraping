# Cascading Style Sheets
# CSS is a language used to style the content of a webpage. it is used to control the presentation of content.
#  html is all about markup css is all about how that markup or content is displayed. for example we could use css to change the color of tags, size of the tags, or background color of the entire page
# to to this we need to target the html elements from with our stylesheet and we do that with css selectors. this is the tag name or attribute

# in the css stylesheet:
# this will target all the p elements and color the text red and make it uppercase

# p {
#   color: red;
#   text-transform: uppercase;
# }


# two popular selectors are the class and id selectors

# = id =
# #title {
#   display: none;
# }
