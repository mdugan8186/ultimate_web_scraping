# ==== the ingredients ====

# every webpage is built up of three key ingredients. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. every time we visit a page on our browser we're simply downloading these three from the server and then interpreting them locally within our browser

# when we type in a webpage address in our browser the browser sends an http request through our ISP (internet service provider), this is then forwarded to a DNS server (this maps domain names to IP addresses), then it is forwarded to the appropriate server (ex. a google server), which serves back html, css, and javascript that makes its way back through the DNS server, through the ISP, back to our machine, back to our browser where it is rendered
