# == HTML ==
# markup language that is used to structure the content of a webpage. it is designed to be both human and machine readable

# HyperText Markup Language
# hypertext refers to the fact that html is a language that allows us to link to other pages
# markup is a way to annotate text with additional information. for instance if we wanted to annotate a sentence with the fact that it's a heading we could markup to do just that

# we do this with html tags. an example would be using the h1 tag to indicate the text within it is a heading:
# <h1>This is a heading</h1>
# <p>Followed by a paragraph</p>

# tags have an opening and closing tag

# there are more than 100 different tags defined, but much less are used in practice.
# many are semantic meaning that they convey content that they wrap. an example with the h1 tag indicates that the text within is a heading
# other tags are structural, meaning they are used to structure the document without communicating any additional meaning with what they contain. an example is the <div> tag. this is used to divide the document into sections, it is a generic container for elements or content and does not tell us anything about what it contains

# the importance of choosing the right tags is mostly for the benefit of other developers and machines (screen readers or keyboards navigators). search engines will also use these tags to better understand our content and rank it accordingly
