# ==== attributes ====

# in addition to the content of the tag we can also add attributes.
# the most popular is probably the href used in anchor <a> tags that provide the link to another page. you can add another attribute that opens the page in a new window called target
# <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Visit Google</a>

# generally attributes are used to provide additional information about a given tag. they define the behavior and the presentation changed completely, but most of the time they are used to provide extra context. the attributes are always specified within the opening tag


# two other popular attributes are class and id
# the id is used to uniquely identify ab element within a page. in proper html a given document can only have one id by a given value
# <h1 id="title"> Some title</h1>

# class attributes are used to specify one or more class names for an html element. tags can also have more than on e class.
# <div class="bordered pink">Some stuff</div>
# <article author="Andy" class="pink"> Some other stuff</article>

# class names are useful for grouping elements together by certain characteristics. this makes it much easier to style the webpage
