# ==== user-agents ====

# user-agents is a piece of software that is used to access a web resource on behalf of the user. it's an agent that acts on behalf of the user

# the agent could be a browser, a web crawler, a bot, a script, or even a tool like httpie

# it is the client in the client server communication it initiates the request which the server responds. it is also responsible for interpreting the response and rendering it for the user

# the level of rendering and the type of rendering varies depending on the type of the agent that is being used. for example modern web browsers will take care of rendering the full html, css, and javascript so that the page looks full of color and is interactive. whereas a command line http agent will simply print the text response to the terminal. both examples the mechanics of the request and the response cycle are exactly the same the only difference is originating from our choice of user agent
