== Objective ==
- Learn to use **Selectolax**, a high-performance HTML/XML parsing library.
- Understand its advantages over BeautifulSoup in terms of speed and CSS selector capabilities.
- Gain deeper practice with **advanced CSS selectors**.

== Motivation ==
- BeautifulSoup is popular but not the only option.
- Selectolax provides a faster and more CSS-focused alternative.
- Helps non-web developers get comfortable with real-world CSS selector syntax.

== Why Use Selectolax ==
1. **Exposure to Alternatives**:
    - There are multiple parsing libraries available.
    - Selectolax is worth learning as a performant alternative to BeautifulSoup.

2. **Performance**:
    - Selectolax is up to 20x faster than BeautifulSoup using the default `html.parser`.
    - This is due to its dependency on fast C libraries like **lexbor** and **modest**.

3. **Focus on CSS Selectors**:
    - Selectolax emphasizes **CSS selector-based searching**, ideal for learning and using complex selectors.

== Installation ==
```bash
pip install selectolax

== Key Characteristics ==
- Lightweight and fast due to C-based backend
- Optimized for speed in large-scale or repeated parsing tasks
- Supports full range of CSS selectors for precise querying

== Coming Up ==
- Parsing HTML using Selectolax
- Writing advanced CSS selectors to target data efficiently
- Comparing output and performance with BeautifulSoup
