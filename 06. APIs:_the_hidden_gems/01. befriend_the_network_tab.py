== Objective ==
- Use the browser's **Network tab** in DevTools to uncover API calls made by a website.
- Learn how to imitate those API requests using Python, avoiding HTML parsing altogether.
- Shift from scraping the *rendered HTML* to fetching *structured data directly* from the server.

== Why Use the Network Tab? ==
- Modern websites often load data dynamically via JavaScript after the initial page load.
- These data requests typically hit backend APIs and return clean JSON payloads.
- Scraping this JSON is faster, cleaner, and more reliable than parsing raw HTML.
- Bypasses CSS/DOM complexity and avoids issues like minified or obfuscated HTML.

== How to Use It ==
- Open the browser's DevTools → go to the **Network** tab.
- Perform an interaction on the page (e.g., click a link or load new content).
- Look for new entries, especially under the **XHR** or **Fetch** filters.
- Click a request to inspect its details:
    - **Request URL** - the API endpoint
    - **Headers** - User-Agent, Accept, Referer, authentication tokens, etc.
    - **Payload / Query Params** - data sent to the server (for POST/GET)
    - **Response** - often JSON; contains the actual data you want to scrape

== What You're Looking For ==
- Endpoints that return structured data (JSON, XML) with useful content like:
    - Product listings
    - Location/store data
    - Search results
    - User profiles or post data
- These are usually triggered by JavaScript when a user interacts with the site.

== Practical Example ==
- Visit a site like Tim Hortons.
- Open the Network tab before clicking anything.
- Click a store locator or menu link.
- Look for a request that returns structured data (not images/scripts).
- Click it → view the response tab → check for readable JSON data.
- If found, this is your scraping target — you can simulate this request in Python.

== Benefits Over HTML Scraping ==
- No need to "inspect and traverse" the HTML tree.
- No dependency on fragile DOM structure or class names.
- Faster scraping (fewer parsing steps and cleaner input).
- Easier error handling (especially if API follows a standard structure).

== Final Strategy ==
- Analyze the site's behavior in DevTools before writing code.
- Identify *what* requests are made, *when* they're made, and *what* data comes back.
- Replicate that request using `requests`, `httpx`, or another Python HTTP library.
- Use the returned JSON for downstream processing and storage.

== Tip ==
- Not all requests return data — some are for tracking or analytics only.
- Watch for ones triggered by interactions — these are more likely to expose real data.
- If the page is blank but network activity returns JSON, you're probably on the right track.

== Next Step ==
- Apply this method to a specific use case:
    - Input a location on a store locator page.
    - Monitor the network request triggered.
    - Extract the API URL and headers.
    - Rebuild the request in Python to scrape all relevant store data.
